HERE'S A LIST OF THE HEADERS ADDED SO FAR:

1. shaderClass.h: This file has a shader class with a constructor that can be used in a project to set up a shader program with vertex and fragment shaders attached to it.
2. textureLoader.h: Basically a texture loader that. (It's almost the same as the one on Learnopengl.com)
